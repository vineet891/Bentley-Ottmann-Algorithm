# Implementation of Algorithm for Reporting and Counting Geometric Intersections

Partial Fulfillment of CS F364 Design and Analysis of Algorithms

## Phase-1

Implementation of Balanced Binary Search trees for Status and Event Queues.
- Red Black trees were chosen over AVL self balancing trees as red-black trees have faster insertion and deletion times.

```
$ g++ -o main.exe src/main.cpp
$ ./main.exe test/<test_filename>.txt
```
or
```
bash run.sh
```
